Welcome to RChain's Architecture documentation!
===============================================

The RChain platform architecture description provides a high-level blueprint to
build a decentralized, economically sustainable public compute infrastructure.
The design results from the inspirations of earlier blockchains and builds on top
of the shoulders of giants in the disciplines of mathematics and programming
language design. This document provides a broad overview of how the whole system
will work together. Links throughout the document provide pointers specific detail.
The Call for Participation section invites you to engage directly with the project
community.

**Intended audience:** This document is written primarily for software designers and
developers who want to help see this vision realized, and for others who want to
support these efforts.
