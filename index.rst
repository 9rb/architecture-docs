RChain Platform Architecture
###############################################

Abstract
===============================================

RChainâ€™s platform architecture is a decentralized, economically sustainable
public compute infrastructure. The platform design results from the inspirations
of earlier blockchains and builds on top of the shoulders of giants in the
disciplines of mathematics and programming language design.

**Intended audience:** This document is written primarily for software designers and
developers who want to help see this vision realized, and for others who want to
support these efforts.
