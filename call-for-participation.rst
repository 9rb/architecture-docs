Call for Participation
################################################################################

We invite you to participate in RChain's Slack channels, joining via http://slack.rchain.coop.

We need a variety of talent, but most urgently programmers with solid computer
science, formal methods, and ideally experience with mobile process calculi and
functional programming. Or, individuals who can demonstrate their ability to
quickly learn these disciplines.

We need investors to help fund the building out this architecture. Note that there
are many forward-looking statements in this document, and are subject to many risks.

Contact Lucius Gregory Meredith and / or Ed Eykholt for more information.
