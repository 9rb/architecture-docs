Applications
**************************************

Any number and variety of applications can be built on top of the RChain Platform that provide a decentralized public compute utility. These include, for example:

* Wallets
* Exchanges
* Oracles & External Adapters
* Custom Protocols
* Smart Contracts
* Smart Properties
* DAOs
* Social Networks
* Marketplaces

Several application providers are already committed to this platform, including `RChain`_ for its social product, `LivelyGig`_ for its marketplaces, `weWOWwe`_ for its sports-based social network, and `Nobex Radio`_ for a to-be-announced product.

Contract Development & Deployment
================================================

The purpose of this next discussion is to illustrate how namespaces allow for heterogeneous deployment of contracts and contract state. Namespaces is one of the crucial features for sharding, and with that we get the benefits analogous of sidechains, private chains, consortium chains, as well as the distinction between test and production, all under one rubric.

For example, the following diagram depicts some of the possible development, test, and deployment configurations and considerations, and how release management is enabled using namespaces and sharding.

We’ll collaborate with IDE tool vendors to integrate Rholang and validation tools. 

Governance
-----------------------------------------------

Like other open source and decentralized projects, and especially those involving money and blockchains, the RChain Platform components will require they be created, tested, released, and evolved with great care. RChain’s leadership fully intends to help define these governance processes and to empower a public community to enforce them.
