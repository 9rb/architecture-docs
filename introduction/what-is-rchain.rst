What is RChain?
################################################################################

The open source RChain project is building a public, Sybil-resistant and censorship-resistant
computing infrastructure based on decentralized blockchain concept. This also has formal
verification of programs during execution, and these programs are defined as *Smart Contracts*.

On top of this technology platform, a broad array of decentralized applications (dApps) can
be built, including those for notarization, private messaging, social networks, monetized
content delivery networks, financial services, marketplaces, governance solutions,
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, and much more.

The decentralization movement is ambitious and will provide awesome opportunities for new
social and economic interactions. Decentralization also provides a counterbalance to
abuses and corruption that occasionally occur in large organizations where power is
concentrated. Decentralization supports self-determination and the rights of individuals
to self-organize. Of course, the realities of a more decentralized world will also have its
challenges and issues, such as how the needs of international law, public good, and
compassion will be honored.

We admire and respect the awesome innovations of the current Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other
platforms that have dramatically advanced the state of decentralized systems and ushered
in this new age of cryptocurrency and smart contracts. However, we also see symptoms that
those projects did not use the best engineering and mathematical models for scaling and
correctness in order to support mission-critical solutions. The ongoing debates about
Bitcoin scaling and the June 2016 issues with The DAO smart contract on Ethereum are
symptomatic of foundational architectural issues. As one example question: Is it scalable
to insist on an explicit serialized processing for all Bitcoin transactions conducted
on planet earth?

To become a blockchain solution with industrial-scale utility, RChain must provide content
delivery at the scale of Facebook and support transactions at the speed of Visa. After due
diligence on the current state of many blockchain projects, after deep collaboration with
Ethereum developers, and after understanding their respective roadmaps, Greg Meredith
concluded that the current and near-term Blockchain architectures cannot meet these
requirements. In mid-2016, Greg (with Synereo Ltd. at the time) resolved to build a better
blockchain architecture. Together with the blockchain industry, we are still at the dawn
of this decentralized movement, and it is now the time to lay down a solid architectural
foundation.

The journey ahead for those who share this ambitious vision is as challenging as it is
worthwhile, and this document summarizes that vision and how we seek to accomplish it.
We compare the blockchains of Bitcoin and Ethereum, outline the RChain architecture,
rationale for its creation, and pointers to initial specifications.
